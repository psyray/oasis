## 🚀 [0.5.0] - 2026-04-20

### Breaking

- **CLI**: Removed **`--adaptive` / `-ad`**; vulnerability analysis is orchestrated exclusively by **LangGraph** (Discover → Scan → Expand → Deep → Verify → Report → optional PoC stage).
- **CLI**: Removed **`--analyze-type` / `-at`** (`standard` | `deep`). Embedding similarity cache segment uses **`file`/`function`** only (`--embeddings-analyze-type` / `-eat`).

### ✨ Added
- 🤖 **Dashboard assistant** (JSON and **executive** MD/JSON): triage chat in the report modal; **executive** opens **scan-wide aggregate** context (run JSON under the model directory) with a **severity** Chart.js rollup, **chat model** list from Ollama (`/api/assistant/chat-models`), **context / system-budget** hints, and optional **embedding-cache RAG** with a **union of file paths** from vulnerability reports in the run (`--web-assistant-rag` / `--no-web-assistant-rag`, overridable per request). Single-vulnerability mode still supports focus on a structured finding via indices, Markdown answers with sanitized HTML, and collapsible **model thinking** blocks when the model emits tagged thinking sections
- 💾 **Assistant chat persistence**: conversations stored under `security_reports/<run>/json/.../chat/` (one session file per chat); list, resume, start new, and delete sessions via REST (`GET`/`DELETE` `/api/assistant/session(s)`, `POST /api/assistant/chat`)
- 🧩 **Assistant stack**: helpers for API validation, path containment, session I/O, RAG retrieval, and thinking parse (`oasis/helpers/assistant_*.py`, `path_containment.py`, `prompt_compose.py`); contract tests in `tests/test_web_assistant_api.py`, `tests/test_assistant_*.py`, `tests/test_path_containment.py`, `tests/test_prompt_compose.py`
- 📎 **CLI custom instructions** for analysis: `--custom-instructions` and `--custom-instructions-file` append user guidance to deep-analysis and **`--poc-assist`** prompts (`resolved_custom_instructions` / `append_user_instructions`)
- 🧠 Added **LangGraph** orchestration (`langgraph` + compatible **langchain-core** as required dependencies) as the sole vulnerability analysis pipeline
- 🎛️ Added **`--langgraph-max-expand`** (`N`): maximum context-expand retries after verify detects structured-output issues (default: **2**)
- 📎 Added **`--poc-hints`** and repurposed **`--poc-assist`**: hints are derived from structured findings only; PoC assist asks the deep model for executable PoC text (**no** automated execution by OASIS)
- 📄 Added canonical JSON reports (`report.json`) via `--output-format` (with `all` and comma-separated lists)
- 🛡️ Added SARIF 2.1.0 export (`sarif/*.sarif`) and dashboard downloads for SARIF
- ⚡ Added incremental reporting during analysis: vulnerability reports are written as each vulnerability completes instead of waiting for end-of-scan
- 📈 Added progressive executive summary updates with scan progress metadata (`completed_vulnerabilities`, `total_vulnerabilities`, `is_partial`) and a `/api/progress` endpoint
- 🧠 Added multi-embed audit execution in one run (`--audit -em model_a,model_b`) with per-model report generation
- 📊 Added `Audit Metrics Summary` generation in audit markdown reports (`Count`, similarity stats, high/medium/low match tiers)
- 🧩 Added dashboard audit comparison table to compare embedding-model metrics from the latest comparable audit run
- 🏷️ Added multi-model selection state in vulnerability cards (badge + model emoji in date chips)
- 📋 Added structured vulnerability analysis (Pydantic) with JSON normalization and repair for flaky model output
- 📍 Added source line metadata: chunk `start_line` / `end_line`, optional per-finding `snippet_start_line` / `snippet_end_line` when the vulnerable snippet is found in the chunk text, SARIF `region` (snippet span preferred over chunk span), and report hints (analysis schema version **3**)
- 🤔 Added Ollama thinking toggles for scan vs deep models (`--model-thinking` / `-mt`, `--small-model-thinking` / `-smt`)
- 🌍 Added report language metadata (`language`) in canonical JSON and dashboard language flags sourced from report data
- 🌐 Added dashboard language filter with emoji-flag display aligned with report language badges
- 🧭 Added `.cursor/` rules and agent skills for implementation, releases, and git conventions
- 📦 **CLI updates from GitHub releases** (no PyPI): **`--check-update`** compares the installed version to the **latest stable** release via the GitHub API (**draft** and **prerelease** releases are ignored); **`--self-update`** reinstalls from `git+https://github.com/psyray/oasis.git@<tag>` using **pipx** when the package is installed under **site-packages** (editable/dev installs get `git pull` guidance). Optional **stderr** notice when a newer stable release exists, with **24 h** on-disk cache under `XDG_CACHE_HOME` / `~/.cache/oasis/`; set **`OASIS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`** to disable. Adds **`packaging`** as a declared runtime dependency for version ordering

### 🐛 Fixed
- 🔧 Fixed **`--embeddings-analyze-type`** default: was incorrectly tied to the removed analyze-type default; default is now **`file`** (`EMBEDDING_ANALYSIS_TYPE`)
- 📝 Fixed vulnerability cards: title/summary shown before the code snippet
- 🔗 Fixed broken download links in the report modal
- 🖥️ Fixed small dashboard issues (types display, parallel refresh, debug logging)
- 🧭 Fixed vulnerability filtering in dashboard so `Executive Summary` remains visible when vulnerability filters are applied
- 🧹 Fixed atomic text writer edge case by cleaning temporary files when write/replace fails
- 🧮 Fixed dashboard progress payload handling to keep only high-level pipeline phases and hide low-level adaptive subphase noise
- 🔎 Fixed report date filtering to support repeated `model` query params and list-based model filtering on the backend
- 🧷 Fixed date-chip model filtering to prefer local report index data and use API fallback only when needed

### ⚡ Changed
- 📄 Canonical JSON and export templates carry **assistant-oriented metadata** where applicable (e.g. embedding model and analysis root context) so the dashboard assistant can align RAG and explanations with the run that produced the report
- 🎨 Dashboard **report preview** styling updates for assistant UX (`dashboard.css`, `report_preview.css`, login polish)
- 🎛️ Tunable **`OASIS_*`** environment variables for Ollama timeouts, `num_predict`, PoC digest/log caps, LangGraph context-expand budgets, and structured-output degeneracy heuristics (documented in README + `oasis/config.py`)
- 🔑 Embedding analyzer per-vulnerability result cache key suffix is **`file`** or **`function`** (replaces obsolete `standard`/`deep` segment from `-at`)
- 💾 Changed cache layout: per-project folders under `.oasis_cache`, schema-aware cleanup for structured outputs
- 🗂️ Changed export writes into `oasis.export` to slim down `report.py`
- 📚 Changed README: `--input` docs, `--output-format`/thinking flags, pipx editable reinstall workflow, vulnerability tag list alignment (`pathtra` and added tags), report folder layout, LangGraph workflow and new flags (replaces adaptive-mode documentation)
- 📈 Changed progressive executive-summary payloads: **`scan_mode=graph`**, LangGraph-aligned **`phases`** rows, and **`EXEC_SUMMARY_PROGRESS_EVENT_VERSION` = 3** for the dashboard wire contract
- 🎨 Changed logo asset
- ♻️ Refactored embedding manager indexing flow into smaller helper methods (argument preparation, result storage, and input preparation reuse)
- 📚 Updated dashboard sorting/filtering helpers to centralize vulnerability ordering and model-selection encoding/decoding
- 🧪 Expanded test coverage for multi-embed audit CLI parsing, audit metrics extraction, dashboard filtering/comparison behavior, and progress payload normalization
