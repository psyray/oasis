## 🚀 [0.5.1] - 2026-04-22

### ✨ Added
- 💬 **Assistant streaming**: **`POST /api/assistant/chat-stream`** (NDJSON) emits `start`, `delta`, `done` / `error` events; dashboard renders the reply progressively under the chat with auto-scroll and falls back to the non-streaming endpoint when the stream is unavailable. Chat composition (chips, input, send) moved below the conversation log.
- 🛡️ **Validate findings**: deterministic investigation (flow / access / config families) with verdict, confidence, and citations — entry points, paths to the sink, taint, mitigations, access and protocol controls, plus config/secret/crypto/log-style checks. **LangGraph** when available, otherwise a sequential fallback. Dashboard: **Validate this finding** and a verdict panel.
- 📝 **Validation narrative**: optional follow-up call to the same **Ollama** chat model to produce readable Markdown; it does not override the deterministic verdict. Request flag to disable; model from the request or the report.
- 💬 **Chat sessions per model**: session JSON **schema_version 3** stores separate threads per chat model plus a **`finding_validations`** map (keyed by file/chunk/finding indices and executive scope path) so multiple validated findings coexist; switching chat model saves the previous thread and reloads the verdict for the currently selected finding. **`POST /api/assistant/chat`** selects the validation entry matching the request finding indices for **`FINDING_VALIDATION_JSON`** in the system prompt. **`POST /api/assistant/investigate`** merges with the same key (includes **`finding_scope_report_path`** in executive mode). Dashboard: pills above **Validate this finding** show the active finding scope.
- 🧩 **Validation support**: shared pattern catalog and taxonomy for all OASIS vulnerability types, with ripgrep-backed scanning and a code fallback.
- 📐 Structured types for validation evidence and investigation results in the analysis schema.
- ✅ Automated tests for validation helpers, APIs, and schema round-trips.

### 🐛 Fixed
- 💬 Assistant: **`POST /api/assistant/session-branch`** accepts **`messages: []`** (e.g. changing chat model before any message) instead of 400 *messages required*.
- 🖼️ Dashboard HTML preview: **Executive Summary** reports in canonical JSON no longer error in the preview path.
- 💬 Assistant streaming: harmony-style reasoning tags emitted by some models (e.g. **gpt-oss** variants like `<|channel>>thought <channel|>`, `<|channel> most_thought <channel|>`, `<|channel|>analysis<|message|>`) are now recognized and extracted into `thought_segments` instead of leaking as raw tokens into `visible_markdown`.
- 💬 Assistant streaming: ollama-python's native `message.thinking` field is forwarded as its own delta channel (`{type: "delta", channel: "thinking"}`), rendered live in a collapsible reasoning block, and appended to `thought_segments` at completion so the visible answer stays clean when `think=True` is negotiated.

## 🚀 [0.5.0] - 2026-04-20

### Breaking

- **CLI**: Removed **adaptive** mode; analysis runs only through **LangGraph** (discover → scan → expand → deep → verify → report, optional PoC).
- **CLI**: Removed **analyze-type** (`standard` / `deep`); embedding similarity cache uses **file** vs **function** only.

### ✨ Added
- 🤖 **Dashboard assistant**: triage chat from the report modal; **executive** mode uses scan-wide aggregate context, severity rollup, Ollama chat model list, system-budget hints, and optional **RAG** over the embedding cache; per-request flags to disable RAG. Single-report mode can target a finding by indices; Markdown replies, sanitized HTML, and optional collapsible **thinking** blocks.
- 💾 **Chat persistence**: conversations saved beside reports; list, open, start new, and delete via REST.
- 🧩 **Assistant plumbing**: validation, safe paths, sessions, retrieval, and parsing helpers with contract tests.
- 📎 **CLI custom instructions** for analysis and for **PoC assist** prompts.
- 🧠 **LangGraph** as the only vulnerability analysis pipeline (with matching dependencies).
- 🎛️ **LangGraph max-expand**: cap on context-expand retries after verify (default **2**).
- 📎 **PoC hints** and **PoC assist**: hints from structured findings only; assist produces suggested PoC text (**no** execution).
- 📄 Canonical **JSON** reports via **output-format** (`all` or comma-separated formats).
- 🛡️ **SARIF 2.1** export and dashboard download support.
- ⚡ **Incremental reporting**: vulnerability JSON written as each type finishes.
- 📈 **Progressive Executive Summary** with scan metadata and a **progress** API.
- 🧠 **Multi-embed audit** in one run with per-model reports.
- 📊 **Audit metrics** in markdown (counts, similarity tiers) and a dashboard **comparison** table across runs.
- 🏷️ **Multi-model** state on vulnerability cards (badges, emojis).
- 📋 **Structured analysis** (Pydantic) with normalization and repair for bad model JSON.
- 📍 Richer **source / snippet line** metadata and SARIF regions; analysis schema bump.
- 🤔 Ollama **thinking** toggles for scan vs deep models.
- 🌍 Report **language** in JSON; dashboard language filter and flags.
- 🧭 Workspace **rules and agent skills** for implementation, releases, and git conventions.
- 📦 **GitHub-based CLI updates**: check and self-update against stable releases (pipx / git), optional update notice with cache, env flag to disable; **packaging** dependency for version ordering.

### 🐛 Fixed
- 🔧 **Embeddings analyze-type** default aligned with the new model (**file**).
- 📝 Vulnerability cards: title and summary before the snippet.
- 🔗 Report modal download links.
- 🖥️ Minor dashboard issues (types, refresh, logging).
- 🧭 Filters no longer hide **Executive Summary** inappropriately.
- 🧹 Safer atomic file writes on failure.
- 🧮 Progress UI: high-level LangGraph phases only, less noisy sub-phases.
- 🔎 Report date filtering and model query handling.
- 🧷 Date-chip model filter prefers local index, API as fallback.

### ⚡ Changed
- 📄 Canonical JSON and exports include **assistant-oriented** metadata (embed model, analysis root) for RAG alignment.
- 🎨 Report preview and login styling for assistant UX.
- 🎛️ More **OASIS_*** env tunables (Ollama timeouts, generation caps, LangGraph budgets, structured-output heuristics); defaults described in the shipped documentation.
- 🔑 Embedding result cache keys use **file** / **function** only.
- 💾 Cache layout: per-project folders with schema-aware cleanup.
- 🗂️ Export logic moved into a dedicated subpackage to slim core reporting code.
- 📚 Documentation refreshed for input/output, thinking flags, pipx workflow, tags, report layout, LangGraph, and removed adaptive-mode docs.
- 📈 Executive-summary progress payload version and **phases** aligned with LangGraph.
- 🎨 Logo update.
- ♻️ Embedding manager refactor into smaller steps.
- 📚 Centralized dashboard sorting/filtering and model encoding.
- 🧪 Broader tests for audit CLI, metrics, dashboard filters, and progress payloads.
