security_context: |
  Laravel specific security considerations:
  - CSRF protection is built-in but needs proper middleware usage
  - Mass assignment vulnerabilities can occur if $fillable/$guarded not properly set
  - SQL injection prevention through Eloquent ORM and query builders
  - XSS prevention using {{ }} vs {!! !!} blade syntax
  - Authentication system with built-in protection against timing attacks
  - File upload vulnerabilities in storage system if not properly validated
